# 3D-Ising-model-MC-simmulation
Slightly modified version of code by rajeshrinet from https://rajeshrinet.github.io/blog/2014/ising-model/#Monte-Carlo-simulation-of-2D-Ising-model to a 3D Ising model.

As for the 2D model the transition temperature predicted by the theoretical derivation agrees with the MC model and it's value is therefore 2.269. But for the 3D model the temperature Tc is achieved by computational means and by comparing with different simmulations it's around 4.5, what agrees with calculations done in this modified code and is concluded by graphs of physical properties of the model.

I'll try to add some reasonable 3D snapshots of configurations later.
